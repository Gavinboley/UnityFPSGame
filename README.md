# UnityFPSGame
A hobby project I created in 2019 where i built my own FPS game's netcode from the ground up because i wanted to learn more about how it works. 

TO PLAY:
1. Install both builds, client and server, and extract them.
2. Run server build exe and accept firewall permissions
3. If you want to play on different networks and not just LAN, forward the port listed in the server terminal(generally 18154) to your computers static internal IP.
4. Run the client build and type 127.0.0.1 in the IP box for lan, or the External IPV4 address of the computer running it for different networks.
